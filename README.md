# FCPIC

To compile the program, we have to run the following command in the **FCPIC** folder (the same  folder where is the makefile):

    make test.exe

Where *test* is the name of the *C++* file we want from the main folder.

We must always add the extension *.exe* to the file's name.

To run the executable file, we have to be in the **bin** folder.
